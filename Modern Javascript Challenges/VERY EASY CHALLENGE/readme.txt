**** VERY EASY: What is the difference between the following JavaScript keywords: var, let and const.  Please provide a written explanation. You are able to include a code reference along with your written explanation for each keyword. ****



SOLUTION: 

VAR is a javascript keyword that allows us to create a variable. However, we can be more specific by using the ES6 terms, LET and CONST.

We would use LET in the same way we use VAR. Create a variable that's value is subject to change somewhere in the program.
     - Ex. let color = prompt('Please select a color');

The biggest difference is with CONST, you create a 'variable' that's value is going to remain the same no matter what (it is constant). This allows us to use more specific keywords, and keep certain values constant and unchanging.
     - Ex. const myName = 'Ben';
