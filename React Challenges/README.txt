Hello! As this project evolved with each stage of challenges, I have provided screenshots showing the differences in development along the way. Each folder contains a screenshot proving that the very easy, easy, and medium challenges were completed. The hard folder contains the code and overall project for submission. Please let me know if you have any questions about my project submission. Thanks!
